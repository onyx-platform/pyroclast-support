=== Selecting relevant events

**Problem:** you have records in your topic with varying attributes, and you only
want to process records that match particular criteria.

**Example:** Suppose you have the following records:

```json
{
  "user": "jim",
  "action": "view-page",
  "page": "/timeline"
}

{
  "user": "sue",
  "action": "favorite-item",
  "item-id": 329572385
}

{
  "user": "cindy",
  "action": "update-status",
  "status": "Going home now."
}
```

You're making a service that's only interested in status update events. Your topic has
events of all types from different users, but you only need to look at events whose
`"action"` key maps to the `"update-status"` value, effectively removing all other
event types from the stream.

**Solution:** use a filter with the `=` predicate.

A filter only allows events to pass through that match the criteria of a particular
predicate. If our criteria is to only allow through event actions matching `"update-status"`,
we can use the `=` predicate to check equality.

==== Removing matching events

Sometimes you'd prefer to do perform the inverse action to filtering - removing events
that match your criteria. Let's suppose instead that you want to process all events
that *are not* a status update. You can either use the `not=` predicate, or continue
to use the `=` predicate and tick the Negate? checkbox.
