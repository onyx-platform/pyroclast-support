=== Splitting a single record into many records

**Problem:** your record has a piece of data that is representative of many records,
and you want to split it apart.

**Example:** Suppose you have the following record:

```json
{
  "activity-batch": [
    {"user": "stu", "action": "retweet"},
    {"user": "lisa", "action": "favorite"},
    {"user": "ron", "action": "tweet"}
  ]
}
```

This record contains a batch of information - three distinct actions for users.
Pyroclast can process this record by itself, but you might want to split it apart
into 3 independent records.

**Solution:** use the `explode` transformation.

`explode` is a function that takes an array value and extracts its subelements into
their own records. In this example, `"activity-batch"` is transformed from a single
array into output with *3* distinct records (denoted by the array around the output).
Each of these records will now flow independently to the subsequent steps.
