=== Coercing datetime values

**Problem:** you have a datetime representation that is that needs to be formatted differently.

**Example:** Suppose you have the following record:

```json
{
  "event-time": "Thu May 11 2017 14:47:42"
}
```

Suppose we want to turn this formatted timestamp into milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

**Solution:** use the `parse-datetime` transformation.

`parse-datetime` takes a target key with the formatted value, and a format string to try
and parse the value with. The format specification follows the JodaTime project. When
a value is successfully parsed, it is turned into milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

==== Parsing Exceptions

When a datetime can't be parsed, an exception is thrown, and the record is not passed
to subsequent tasks.

==== Unparsing Unix epoch values

Sometimes you want to go in the other direction: turning a timestamp value that
is in milliseconds since the Unix epoch to a formatted value. We use the
`format-unix-ms-timestamp` function to handle this. `format-unix-ms-timestamp`
takes a key which has an epoch value, and a format to transform the value into.
