=== Diangosing unconforming data

**Problem:** you have records in your topic that may not all conform to the your expected
schema, and you want to find them.

**Example:** Suppose you have the following records:

```json
{
  "user": "bob",
  "age": 28
}

{
  "user": "alice",
  "age": "thirty-two"
}
```

If your service expects all ages to be integers, an exception will be thrown at some
point if you try to perform a numeric operation on the event for Alice, since age
is a string with a number spelled out in English. We want to find all the events with
a non-integer age.

**Solution:** use a filter with the `integer?` and throw exceptions on unmatched events.

Filters have a checkbox option to "Throw exception on unmatch?". When an event fails
to meet the criteria for a predicate, it is normally silently discarded from flowing
further down to subsequent tasks. In this case, we're interested in finding events that
don't conform to our expectations that age is an integer, and we want to know which
records these are so that we can perform further diagnosis about where they came from
and why. If we check the box to throw on unmatch, records that don't meet the criteria
throw an exception at runtime, and the record's value will be visible inside the Exception
information box in a deployment.

==== Negated filters with unmatched exceptions

In the above scenario, we selected the option to throw an exception when a record does
not meet the criteria of the record - for example, `"age"` is an integer.

We can do the inverse as well. By selecting the Negate? checkbox, Pyroclast will throw
exceptions for all events that pass the specified predicate. For example, to throw
exceptions on all values that have an empty string, we could use the `empty?` predicate,
negated, and throw on unmatched. With this, the value `"visit-page"` will continue to flow
downstream, but the empty string, `""`, will throw a runtime exception.
