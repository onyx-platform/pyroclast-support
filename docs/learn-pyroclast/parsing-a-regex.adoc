=== Parsing regular expressions into named values

**Problem:** you want to apply a regular expression to a string and name each of the group matches.

**Example:** Suppose you have the following record:

```json
{
  "date": "Jan-13-1991"
}
```

If we apply a regular expression to capture the month, day, and year in the `"date"`
key, we want to be able to name each of these values for independent use.

**Solution:** use the `extract-regex-match` and `zipmap` transformations.

A clean solution is to use two functions together. First, `extract-regex-match` does
the obvious heavy lifting in applying a regular expression to a string. This function
returns an array of matches, with the first element being the target string itself as
is standard.

Next, apply the `zipmap` function, which takes an array of values, and a sequence of keys
to "zip" against it. In this example, we zip the array of parsed values with a key sequence
denoting the name of each value to achieve a map of named matches.
