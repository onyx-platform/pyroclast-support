=== Parsing value types

**Problem:** you have records whose values are of a different type than you want.

**Example:** Suppose you have the following record:

```json
{
  "first-name": "steven",
  "age": "45"
}
```

Perhaps you'd like to make an aggegate over all your events to find the average age.
Notably, age isn't an integer in this record - it's a string. We need to turn it
into a number before we can apply an average.

**Solution:** use the `parse-vals` transformation.

`parse-vals` takes a map of key names to string type values. The keys are
the keys in the record to parse, and the values are the target types to to.

In this case, we specify a parse map to turn the "age" key into an "integer".
Notably, you only need to specify the desired type, and not the type to convert
from.

==== Parsing multiple values

`parse-vals` is capable of parsing many keys in a single invocation. Simply
add more key/value pairs to the parse map. In the next example, we parse
both an age to an integer, and a boolean flag denoting whether or not this
user is from a legancy system.

==== Unparseable values

When a value can't be parsed to its target type, an exception is thrown.
The record will not proceed to the next task, and the exception will be
listed in the deployment screen. The string `"banana"` can't be parsed
to an integer, so an exception is thrown.

==== Handling null values

Null values will throw an exception when they're attempted to be parsed.
If you're excepting some of your values to be null and that's okay for your
application, tick the "Allow Nulls?" box underneath the Parse Map text box.
This has the effect of not attempting to parse the value, passing it through
unmodified.

==== Limitations

At this time, parse-vals only worked on top-level keys. If you need to parse a nested
value, move it to the top of the map using the `move` function. This will be addressed
in the future.
