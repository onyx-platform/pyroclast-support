=== Accessing nested values

**Problem:** you want to retrieve or set a value nested inside a record.

**Example:** Suppose you have the following record:

```json
{
  "team": [
    {"user": "bob", "points": 51},
    {"user": "malinda", "points": 98},
    {"user": "ron", "points": 640}
  ]
}
```

Further, suppose you want to double the number of points for the first user in every team.
This would involve using the `times` function, but we need a way to express
that the target key is nested.

**Solution:** use a key sequence.

A key sequence is an array of keys to progressively "get"
from the map or array, after which the value is taken. To get the first user's points
in the team, the key path is `["team", 0, "points"]`. `"team"` is the key, which yields
an array of users. `0` is the "key", in this case an index into the array, which yields
another map - the user map. The final key is `"points"`, which accesses a non-collection
value.

Almost all functions in Pyroclast accept key sequences for the source and target keys, allowing
you to move values up and down a records' hierarchy arbitrarily.
