=== Assigning default values

**Problem:** a key in your record might not have a value, and you want to default it if it doesn't.

**Example:** Suppose you have the following records:

```json
{
  "user": "john",
  "premium?": true
}

{
  "user": "sally":
}
```

Only the first record has a flag for `"premium?"`. Suppose we want all records to conform
to the same schema, and for some records, we're going to need to provide a default value
if there isn't one present already.

**Solution:** use the `assoc-default` transformation.

`assoc-default` takes a key and a value. If the value for that key is null (e.g. it's not present),
the provided value will be associated with the key.  If a value already exists, it is not modified.
