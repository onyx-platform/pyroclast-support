=== Changing Event Structure

**Problem:** your records are in a structure that is different from what you want.

**Example:** Suppose you have the following record:

```json
{
  "favorites": {
    "color": "red"
  }
}
```

Let's say you'd like to restructure the event so that `"favorite-color"` is moved
from being a nested key into a top level key.

**Solution:** use the `move` transformation.

`move` takes a source sequence of keys to a target value and a destination
sequence of keys to denote where the value should be moved to. A "key sequence"
is an array of keys to progressively "get" from the map or array, after which
the value is taken.

==== Moving a value in an array

`move` can lift values out of arrays by specifying its index as the "key"
in the key sequence. In this example, we have an array of number of hits
in a 6-inning baseball game. If we're interested in lifting the number of
hits in the 3rd inning to a top level key, we can get a handle on it with
`["hits", 2]`, where 2 is the zero-based index of the `"hits"` array.

==== Moving a submap to the top

`move` can also lift a submap to the top level of a record using `[]` as the
destination key sequence. Notable, this "splats" the submap to the parent map,
remove the submap entirely. In this example, we move all the keys under
`"person"` and make them top level keys in the record.

==== Nesting values further

Instead of moving a value from a nested position in a map into a higher level,
we can also push it further down. In this example, we take a generic top level
key and put it in a more specific key structure.

Keys in submaps will be automatically created. Array indexes are valid in the last
position, so long as the target array exists. Arrays will *not* be automatically
created.
